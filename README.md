This game is simple, so what is cool about it? The fact that the logic which runs it, resides on the blockchain as a token data item. It could run completely serverless
using the blockchain as a server. The cool thing is that as long as one person is running a node, this data is there for you to use forever! That is what
the new management is all about, replacing standard web2 platforms with web3 tools. The best part is our tools plug in with existing tech stacks.
